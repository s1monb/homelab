# Homelab

This is the repo for my 2-node homelab built on proxmox. It is primarily meant
to be a kubernetes testinglab, but I also use it to run certain applications
for my household.

## Prerequisites

There are a ton of paths you can to take when running both you own infra-
and own platform-layer in a homelab-environment. Because of this fact, it
will be hard to make a homelab-repo so generic that it can fit all your needs
as well as mine. However I have tried to make the parts/modules in this repo
decoupled and *transposable*.
